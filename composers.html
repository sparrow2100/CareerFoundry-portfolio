                I created the women composers app in two versions: React and
                Angular frontend, with my women composers API as a backend. The
                app allows users to discover and learn about female composers of
                western classical music. After registering or logging in, users
                are able to click on a composer to read about them, and add or
                remove them from a list of favourites which can be viewed in the
                user profile.

            <p class="spaced">
              The objective for this project was to create a “MyFlix” movie app
              for an assignment in the CareerFoundry full stack development
              course. I wanted to challenge myself by personalizing the project,
              while still meeting the requirements. I’m passionate about
              furthering knowledge of women in western music history, and spent
              time studying music and gender during my musicology degree. I
              decided to meet with my mentor and pitch my idea of a women
              composers app, and set to work putting together research on
              different composers for the API!

              I started the project by creating my own API. I had used APIs
              before in other projects, so I found it very interesting to get
              behind-the-scenes knowledge about how they actually work. I gained
              experience with both relational and non-relational databases,
              through my practice database with PostgreSQL and project database
              with MongoDB. It was fun researching the composers, and figuring
              out how different aspects of a composer’s life would be best
              structured in a database.

              I learned how to route HTTP requests using Express, define
              endpoints and test them with Postman, and implement authentication
              and authorization using HTTP and JWT authentication. Since this
              was my first time learning about backend, it was challenging in
              the beginning. However, as my understanding of the concepts grew,
              so did my understanding of how other people’s APIs worked in my
              previous projects.

              The first version of the app I created was with React. Since I had
              previously worked with React, it went fairly smoothly. However,
              form validation and app routing were new to me, but were a
              rewarding challenge.

              I’m glad I approached the Angular version of the app with an
              understanding of how the final product should work and look, as
              well as excitement to learn a new framework, because understanding
              how to use Angular was challenging. I made some user flows that I
              used for both the React and Angular versions of the app, and
              planned the various tasks with a Kanban board:

              Throughout the project, I encountered a few particularly
              challenging problems I needed to solve. The main problem was that
              the guidance provided in the project instructions wasn’t working
              for me, and I was not getting the desired results from them. After
              researching Angular and looking at several previous student
              examples, I determined the version used in the exercises’ example
              code was too outdated. I started the app over from scratch with a
              newer version, and everything worked. Although it was frustrating,
              in retrospect I’m glad I had the chance to redo my work as it gave
              me another opportunity to practice and for the concepts to further
              sink in, and I think I have a much better understanding of Angular
              as a result.

              Looking back on the project, I’m pleased with the results. I am
              especially happy that I decided to centre the assignment around
              composers, as it kept me engaged throughout the development
              process and excited about the final product. However there are a
              few things I would like to change and add as I continue my
              development, which I believe will improve the app overall:
            </p>
            <ul class="spaced">
              <li>
                I would like to revisit and polish the design of the app,
                especially the React version, to make it stand out. Although I
                think it was important to learn how to use React Bootstrap
                during the assignment, I enjoy the creativity of customizing the
                designs of my apps.
              </li>
              <li>
                I plan to add a loading screen for the signup and login features
                in the app.
              </li>
              <li>
                I would like to change the date format for the birth date in the
                profile, so it is more readable.
              </li>
              <li>
                I would like to add era information (Baroque, Classical, Modern
                etc.) to the composer cards, as well as a filter by era feature.
              </li>
              <li>
                The app should automatically navigate to the login page after a
                new user signs up.
              </li>
              <li>
                I am excited to research and add more composers to the database!

              learned something about women composers!
